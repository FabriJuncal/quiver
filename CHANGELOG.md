# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- AI CLI orchestration commands for provider dry-runs, planner phases, executor slice runs, and GitHub PR preflight.
- AI-first default project layout with visible onboarding docs and internal `.quiver/` machinery.
- Generated spec/slice/handoff/PR artifacts with mandatory `slice-00`.

### Changed

- Published `create-quiver` 0.10.0 and aligned the root docs with the current release line.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- Auto-install `create-quiver` as a dev dependency after `init` and `migrate` — detects yarn/pnpm/bun/npm via lockfiles and runs the appropriate install command
- `--skip-install` flag to suppress the dev dependency install step (useful for CI environments)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- `quiver:plan` — lists all pending slices in dependency order with estimated hours, status, and critical path
- `quiver:graph` — visualizes the slice dependency graph in ASCII tree, Mermaid, and DOT formats
- `quiver:next` — suggests the next ready slice; supports `--all-ready`, `--json`, and `--auto-start`
- Slice graph library — `readAllSlices`, `buildGraph`, `topoSort`, `computeLevels`, `detectFileConflicts` for programmatic graph access
- `depends_on` and `parallel_safe` fields with validation in `check-slice`
- JSON-with-comments support for slice templates
- Cross-platform CI matrix covering macOS, Linux, and Windows for the Node-native runtime
- Node-native generated project npm scripts and additive migration support for existing projects

### Fixed

- `quiver:plan` no longer crashes on repos with legacy bare spec names in the `dependencies` field (e.g. `"quiver-v01"`) — these are silently dropped instead of throwing `MISSING_DEPENDENCY`

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- `create-quiver` CLI installer surface
- Post-init `doctor` validation mode
- Release helper script and packaged-installer smoke checks

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- MIT license
- Portable `init-docs.sh`
- `package.template.json`
- English canonical documentation
- `examples/01-basic-slice/`
